        I am a <strong>27-year-old passionate photographer</strong> based in{" "}
        <strong>Toulouse</strong>. Photography, for me, is a way to explore
        human emotions and capture the essence of each individual and every
        situation.

        I have always found <strong>portraits fascinating</strong>, as every
        gaze and every expression tells a unique story. What also draws me to
        photography is the <strong>magic of the night</strong>. The soft light,
        the shadows creating new shapesâ€”all of this fuels my imagination and
        pushes me to create intense images.

        Each shot is, for me, an invitation to{" "}
        <strong>rediscover the world</strong> from a different perspective,
        where the suspended moment reveals its full power.

        Like many photographers before me, what started as a{" "}
        <strong>hobby</strong> has become my work, and my passion drives me to
        invest <strong>100%</strong> in every project I take on. For the past{" "}
        <strong>five years</strong>, I have been challenging myself to become a
        better photographer, so it would be a pleasure to collaborate with you.
